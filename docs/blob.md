# Blob Storage

## Main Components

* __Storage Account:__ Every storage account has an unique namespace that is used to generate the address for the blob.
* __Container:__ The container is like a folder on the file system.
* __Blobs:__ Blobs are like files on the file system. In this way, the container holds the blobs.
